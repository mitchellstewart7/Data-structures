# Data-structures
This repository displays some of the work done in my data structures class.

# Linked List and Dynamic Array - Assignment 1
These programs implement a linked list and dynamic array data strcutures. The dynamic array increases in size automatically as elements are added to it, and uses void pointers so as to accept any data type. The linked list also makes use of void pointers, and both data structures free all allocated memory.

# Stack and Queue - Assignment 2
These programs implement a stack, queue, and queue made using two stacks. The stack uses a last in first out structure, while the queue functions like a line at the grocery store (first in first out). The queue made with two stacks functions by pushing and popping back and forth between the two stacks. Like the first assignment, void pointers ensure the data structures will work on any data type.

# Binary Search Tree - Assignment 3
This program implements a binary search tree. This data structure organizes things so that the root has up to two child nodes, with nodes going to the right indicating greater numbers and those to the left indicating lower numbers. This pattern also continues down the tree. The most difficult part of developing the binary search tree was removal of elements and subsequent restructuring of the tree.

# Priority Queue - Assignment 4
This program implements a priority queue. This data structure functions by inserting nodes into a dynamic array, and everything is organized based on the priorities given to the nodes. As the same dynamic array developed earlier is used in this program, void pointers are used to accomodate every data type.
